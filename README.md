# cemetery-map
A responsive Python+Flask+Google Maps app that allows people to search for loved ones in a cemetery.

This application is a Flask rewrite of a previous Node.js app written by @jbshep and his students, which was designed specifically for the cemetery in Storm Lake, Iowa, U.S.A.

The first full commit of the source of cemetery-map will include setup instructions and guidance for interested student contributors.
